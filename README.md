This is a learning attempt to see how interactive we can make the Github readme.md file.

# Backstory

Whenever I add an image link to the Github readme file itâ€™s always getting replaced with â€˜https://camo.githubusercontent.com/some-hashâ€™ proxy url.

I wondered why it was happening like that. I mean, itâ€™s okay to proxy an external url, but why are even static images placed in repositories getting a proxy url when they're referenced from a readme file? What is Github trying to achieve here?

Then I thought what would happen if there was no proxy server involved while serving the images. If there is no proxy, then the http request to fetch the image will directly come to our server(where we host the image) and we can read the http request and try to get a user ip address, which can be used for any tracking purposes and Github will have no control over it.

So I kind of understood the reason behind why Github added the image proxy server. At this stage, I wanted to know whether itâ€™s possible to get any unique identification from the http request made from the user machine.

I hoped there would be a way to uniquely identify each session/machine. So I thought of building a simple game that can be played from within the markdown file itself to test that. The idea was to build a multiplayer game where each player would have their own state saved against a unique id. "Tic-tac-toe" game seems to be a good fit for this, since it's a well-known game, and itâ€™s fairly straightforward to implement.

After I started the development, I quickly found out there was no way we could get a unique id from the http request fired from the readme markdown file. This is because each time a request comes from a random proxy server, and on top of that, cookies are not allowed either. So, without a unique id, there wonâ€™t be any states saved for each player, and individual game play is impossible. Therefore, a single game play will be shared with the entire internet.

At this stage, I thought of abandoning the quest, but playing a game from the Github Readme.md file itself seems like a cool idea, even when the gameplay is shared with the entire internet. So I ran this idea by my friends, and they seemed interested in seeing how this would turn out, so I thought of investing some time in developing this.
